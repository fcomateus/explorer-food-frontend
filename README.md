# Explorer Food
Explorer Food simulates a website where a restaurant owner can manage his dishes, creating, updating or deleting dishes.

It also can be used by the costumers, where they can look what dishes the restaurant has.

Food Explorer uses React + Vite and other libs, like styled-components, framer motion, axios, etc.

It's the final project of Explorer program on Rocketseat
